# Auth App

## Task

Make an application that allows the **user to log in**. All users in the system are also displayed.
The work should be done via the API

## App

**User can log in** (otherwise app will ask for this). Logging in provides **validation**.

After user logged in, on main page displays users in system.

They can be sorted by _index_ (click on _id_), and filtered by _username_ (click on _username_ will display filter input)

The user can **log out**. Then there will be no users on the main page, and the application will request login.
